			<p>I've been learning web development with The Odin Project, it's a lot of fun but I do need more hands-on experience. So I'm making this site as a way to get that.
				I'm using BEM for my naming conventions to try and enforce good habits early on. We'll see how that works out I guess.</p>
			<p>Below are a bunch of links to different test pages, hope you enjoy!</p>
